For an advanced and developer-friendly language like GX in 2024, you might want to consider an open-source license that encourages collaboration and contributions. The MIT License is a permissive license commonly used for open-source software. Below is an example of how you can include the license section in your `README.md`:

```markdown
# GX Programming Language

...

## License

GX is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
```

Make sure to include a `LICENSE` file in your project repository containing the full text of the MIT License. This license allows developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions.

Feel free to choose another license that aligns better with your project's goals and the level of openness you desire. Popular choices include MIT, Apache, GPL, or others. Be sure to understand the implications of each license and how it aligns with your project's objectives.
